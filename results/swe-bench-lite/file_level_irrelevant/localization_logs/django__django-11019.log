Please look through the following GitHub problem description and Repository structure and provide a list of folders that are irrelevant to fixing the problem.
Note that irrelevant folders are those that do not need to be modified and are safe to ignored when trying to solve this problem.

### GitHub Problem Description ###
Merging 3 or more media objects can throw unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings
Description
	
Consider the following form definition, where text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js but all other JS files are independent:
from django import forms
class ColorPicker(forms.Widget):
	class Media:
		js = ['color-picker.js']
class SimpleTextWidget(forms.Widget):
	class Media:
		js = ['text-editor.js']
class FancyTextWidget(forms.Widget):
	class Media:
		js = ['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']
class MyForm(forms.Form):
	background_color = forms.CharField(widget=ColorPicker())
	intro = forms.CharField(widget=SimpleTextWidget())
	body = forms.CharField(widget=FancyTextWidget())
Django should be able to resolve the JS files for the final form into the order text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js. However, accessing MyForm().media results in:
/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:
text-editor-extras.js
text-editor.js
 MediaOrderConflictWarning,
Media(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])
The MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.
The final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the "na√Øve" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)
