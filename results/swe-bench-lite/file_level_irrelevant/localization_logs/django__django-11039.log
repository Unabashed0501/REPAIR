Please look through the following GitHub problem description and Repository structure and provide a list of folders that are irrelevant to fixing the problem.
Note that irrelevant folders are those that do not need to be modified and are safe to ignored when trying to solve this problem.

### GitHub Problem Description ###
sqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL
Description
	 
		(last modified by Simon Charette)
	 
The migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT ​if the migration is atomic and ​the schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.
The issue can be addressed by
Changing sqlmigrate ​assignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.
Adding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on ​an existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.
I marked the ticket as easy picking because I included the above guidelines but feel free to uncheck it if you deem it inappropriate.
