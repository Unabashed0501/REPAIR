Please look through the following GitHub problem description and Repository structure and provide a list of folders that are irrelevant to fixing the problem.
Note that irrelevant folders are those that do not need to be modified and are safe to ignored when trying to solve this problem.

### GitHub Problem Description ###
Allow FilePathField path to accept a callable.
Description
	
I have a special case where I want to create a model containing the path to some local files on the server/dev machine. Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:
import os
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
class LocalFiles(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
	file = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))
Now when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir
I had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.

Please only provide the full path.
Remember that any subfolders will be considered as irrelevant if you provide the parent folder.
Please ensure that the provided irrelevant folders do not include any important files needed to fix the problem
The returned folders should be separated by new lines and wrapped with ```
For example:
```
folder1/
folder2/folder3/
folder4/folder5/
```
