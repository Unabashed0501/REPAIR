### GitHub Problem Description ###
Correct expected format in invalid DurationField error message
Description
	
If you enter a duration "14:00" into a duration field, it translates to "00:14:00" which is 14 minutes.
The current error message for invalid DurationField says that this should be the format of durations: "[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]". But according to the actual behaviour, it should be: "[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]", because seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and hours are optional if minutes are provided.
This seems to be a mistake in all Django versions that support the DurationField.
Also the duration fields could have a default help_text with the requested format, because the syntax is not self-explanatory.
